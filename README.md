## CHANGING THE GAME - Female representation in Olympic History


For this project I chose to analyse the [120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) database, which contains Olympic Games data from 1896 to 2016. I explored the data using SQL and then I decided to focus on gender disparities to present on a dashboard.

**Dashboard:** [CHANGING THE GAME](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/renan.nunes/viz/OLYMPICS_17221996779570/Dashboard1)

### Dataset

The athlete_events.csv file contains 271116 rows and  columns. where each row corresponds to an athlete competing in an olympic event.


### Key takeaways

* Out of all analysed games, the one with highest proportion of female participation were the summer games held in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 representing 45% of total athletes. Vancouver 2010 had 40.7% of women competing, being the winter edition with highest female representation.
* 120 years before, in the first edition of the modern games, no woman competed. In the next games, they represented only 1,7% of total athletes.
* During the first edition, athletes competed in 43 different events. In 2016 this number was 306 and that 136 were female events and 9 mixed.
* Regarding the winter games, in 90 years the number of events went from 17 to 98 events. Womenâ€™s events went from 1 to 43 and mixed ones increased from 2 to 6.

Exploring this dataset was also a deep dive in world's history and geography. Some fun facts I have found are:
* The american sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward was the oldest person to compete, at 97 years old. Personally, the most interesting past was finding out that, between 1912 and 1948, the summer games awarded works of art inspired by the sport in the fields of architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpting.
* On the other hand, the youngest athlete to ever compete was the greek gymnast Dimitrios Loundras which was only 10 in 1896.
